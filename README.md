# Our Mostrox (Godot)

Requires Godot 4

Completed in 2025

This videogame is a remake of its original mobile version, now improved and fully completed. It is a project focused on generative AI, built around a core design question: what is the right way to use and truly take advantage of this technology within gameplay?

One thing is to use AI as a shortcut for coding or asset generation, which is unethical and often leaves a poor impression in the final product, making it feel lazy or like a random collage of disconnected elements. Another, very different approach, is to design an experience that emerges naturally from the capabilities and qualities of generative AI itself, resulting in a unique, niche gameplay that might not have existed without this technology.

Our Mostrox is a code-driven prompt generator. Monsters are created from discretized choices, represented internally as numerical arrays. Externally, the player can then use any of the many available generative technologies to transform those numbers into narrative descriptions and images. That is only the first step. Monster battles are handled in a similar way: the system leverages the AI’s rational, multi-variable analysis combined with a controlled hallucinatory touch, producing results that are vivid yet objective.

Under normal circumstances, this process would belong to two very different worlds. On one side, the narrative writer, who may not perform multi-variable simulations but can deliver more epic and creative storytelling. On the other, the programmer, who could build simulated or probabilistic systems to calculate which monster wins. In this project, AI converges both approaches into a simple yet sufficient result.

Most importantly, the user is free to choose. The generated prompt can be handed to a visual artist to paint the monster, or to a writer to narrate an epic battle. The system is flexible enough to handle any kind of input. It can even serve as a social and comparative experiment, confronting pure human art against the systematic aberration and madness of machines.

As a videogame developer, I created this product as an experimental work. My personal brand is centered on a hand-drawn style, backed by years of programming experience from a time before AI existed. I do not endorse the use of generative AI in the creative world, as it replaces innate creativity, talent, and expression, while encouraging laziness and a culture of immediacy. This project is an exception within my portfolio. Its purpose is to enrich it by demonstrating adaptability to a new technology, using it in a gameplay context that genuinely leverages its nature.
